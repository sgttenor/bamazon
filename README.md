In this app, we'll mimic a store like Amazon that will be like a store front where users will be asked specific things.

Using the bamazonCustomer.js file will prompt you with a list of items with IDs. Type in 'node bamazonCustomer.js'...

You'll get a list of items. It should prompt you to make a choice.

We can also allow a psuedo-manager look at the list of available purchases, low inventory. Even add a NEW product and add more to the stock.

We start by console logging in 'node bamazonManager.js'.....

The console will provide a list of things to choose from.....

![screenshot16](https://github.com/sgttenor/screenshots/blob/master/screenshot16.PNG)

'View all products' will give us the same table as above in screenshot12

We'll choose 'View Low Inventory'... and it will show all the product that have quantities of 5 or less. Then prompt the same list

'Add to Inventory" will add more stock to the list of choices available.

We'll add more stock to God of War....

'God of War' was updated by 20 to 25

'Add New Product' will add a product to the table.
We'll add Red Dead Redemption to the Video-Games department with price and quantity.
